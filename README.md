Finite State Machines with Python, a script implements FSMs 

<i><b>1\ What is FSM?</b><i/>

According to Wiki:
      A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, 
      or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of 
      a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some external inputs; 
      the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, 
      and the conditions for each transition. Finite state machines are of two types â€“ deterministic finite state machines and non-deterministic
      finite state machines.[1] A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one."


<i><b>2\ Scripting an FSM with Python:</b><i/>

<b>Automate.py</b>: by using this file you can create FSMs, here a simple code:</br>
      Where the previous variables are: <br/>
      
      # Creation of states
       s1 : State 
       s1 = State(1, True, False) 
       s2 = State(2, False, True) 
       # Creation of transitions 
       t1 = Transition(s1,"a",s1)
       # t2 : Transition 
       t2 = Transition(s1,"a",s2) 
       # t3 : Transition 
       t3 = Transition(s1,"b",s2) 
       # t4 : Transition 
       t4 = Transition(s2,"a",s2)
       # t5 : Transition 
       t5 = Transition(s2,"b",s2)
       auto1 = Automate([t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6], [s0,s1,s2])
      
      print(auto)               #In order to show the FSM
      auto.show("A_ListeTrans") #In order to save it as a File "A_ListeTrans.pdf"
